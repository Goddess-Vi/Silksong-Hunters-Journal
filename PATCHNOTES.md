# Pale Spider's Journal Patch Notes
The official release notes for the Pale Spider's Journal website
___
## v0.4.0 (December 18, 2025)
* ***Beta mobile support***
    * This version is very rough with some glaring issues, but is overall functional
    * Some issues are:
        * Some creatures being to large to be completely visible
        * The "Abyss" filter is completely inaccessible 
        * The "Cradle" filter is barely accessible
* **Patch notes patch notes**
    * I made a glaring issue with the previous patch note, update the website an entire year in the future, on December 16, 202***6*** rather than 202***5***
    * Additionally I mispelled future

If you notice any additional issues with both the mobile version and the desktop version, please notify me either on my [Twitter](https://x.com/g0ddessv1) or email me 26KLanning@gmail.com
___
## v0.3.0 (December 16, 2025)
* ***Every filter is now fully functioning***
### Next to come:
In the next updates, the currently listed features plan to be fully implemented, getting every creatures information properly put into the site. The order I would like to do this in (although may not be followed) is:
1. Full body images
2. Kills required for entry
3. Health
4. Drops

Once all of this is implemented I will deem the site to be on full release, v1.0.0, with any future major versions (e.g. v2.0.0) coming with DLC additions to the game, such as next years "Sea of Sorrow" dlc.
___
## v0.2.0 (December 15, 2025)
* ***Every creature now has their decription & comment, making the journal equivalent to that in-game***
* Adjusted some styling to make things more uniform across different resolutions
* Every creature now resets the following boxes when selecting a creature without that information added:
    * Journal kill requirement
    * Health
    * Drops
___
## v0.1.1 (December 11, 2025)
* Every creature now has their name appropriately listed
* Every creature up to the "Last Judge" has their description & comment added
### What's next to come?
In future updates, I will add a section for the total amonut of creatures slain to complete their entry.
Additionally we plan to add better mobile device compatibility whilst adding in the rest of the descriptions & comments

___
## v0.1.0 (December 9, 2025)
#### The site includes the following:
* The portrait of all the creatures in Hollow Knight: Silksong
* A prototype filter system that works however only a select few creatures work within the filter as of right now
* A section for the health of creatures, including black-threaded if possible (Select few have this)
* A section for the locations of enemies (Every creature!)
* A section for the rosary and shell shard drops of creatures
* A section for the creature's in-game description & comment (Only some)
* The creature's name (Only some)
### What's next to come?
The next version of the website will have every creature's name filled out with around 50% of the creature's having their descriptions & comments filled in
